#web applications
I used Python, Tkinter and SQL for this applications.
Due to my knowledge with SQL-Server, I like to incorporate databases it into my projects.
I use a less powerful SQLite3 on this occasion for its assimilation with Tkinter.
I created some important fitness related web applications:

Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire - PAR-Q Form, 
Target Heart Rate THR, 
Body Mass Index BMI, 
Waist To Hip Ratio WHR, 


THR.
Your maximum heart rate is about 220 minus your age. In the age category closest to yours. Target heart rate during moderate intensity activities is about 50-70% of maximum heart rate, while during vigorous physical activity it’s about 70-85% of maximum. Src. heart.org

BMI.
Body mass index is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m², resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres. Src. Wikipedia

WHR.
Waist to hip ratio (WHR) measures the ratio of your waist circumference to your hip circumference. It determines how much fat is stored on your waist, hips, and buttocks.
